The DPC++ Compatibility Tool (DPCT) introduced by Intel can mi-grate CUDA projects to Data Parallel C++. However, the migrationprocess requires much manual effort. In this paper, we introduceDPCT-Companion, which automatically fixes warnings generatedby DPCT, and provides a test harness and profiler plugin for DPC++and CUDA. We tested DPCT-Companion on both small-scale andlarge-scale CUDA projects. The results show that DPCT Companioncould automatically fix around 26% of the warnings by categories,and 66% of the warnings by occurrences, suggesting its efficiency insaving manual efforts. The test harness and profiler plugin enablesthe comparison of the CUDA and DPC++ versions of the programin detail and provides rich information for developers to furtheroptimize the migrated code.
